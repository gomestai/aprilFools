# Prank Like a Dev ðŸ˜ˆ

This project was created for my Medium article:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Prank Like a Dev: April Fools with MediaRecorder API & AWS Amplify](https://medium.com/@tufekcisencer/prank-like-a-dev-april-fools-with-mediarecorder-api-aws-amplify-55b400c97f16)

## What is it?

A harmless little April Fools' prank designed to look like a profile picture verification page. It:

- Requests camera access from the user
- Displays a fake UI to make them focus
- Plays a scary sound and image when the button is clicked
- Records the user's reaction using the MediaRecorder API
- Downloads the video locally (nothing is uploaded!)

## Disclaimer

This version includes both a **cute lamb** and the **classic scary face**. The deployed example uses the lamb, but feel free to switch to the scary version in the code if you're feeling mischievous ðŸ˜„
